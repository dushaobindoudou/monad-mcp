# MCP Wallet

A comprehensive Web3 wallet SDK based on the MCP (Model-Context-Protocol) for interacting with Monad and other EVM-compatible blockchains. This library provides a secure, feature-rich wallet implementation that can be integrated into any JavaScript/TypeScript application or used directly with AI assistants that support MCP.

## 🤖 MCP Integration - Core Features

MCP Wallet is primarily designed to work with MCP-enabled AI assistants. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables secure, two-way connections between AI models and external tools like this wallet.

### What is MCP?

MCP (Model-Context-Protocol) is a protocol that allows AI models to interact with external tools and services. In the context of this wallet:

- It enables AI assistants to help users manage their crypto assets securely
- It provides standardized ways for LLMs to access wallet functionality
- It maintains security boundaries to protect private keys and sensitive operations

### MCP Capabilities

This wallet exposes the following capabilities through MCP:

1. **Read-only operations**: Get wallet address, check balances, view transaction history
2. **Preparation operations**: Create transaction objects, estimate gas fees, suggest swap routes
3. **Information services**: Token price information, network status, chain information
4. **Security-focused design**: No direct access to private keys, user confirmation required for transactions

#### Basic Operations
- Get wallet address and balance
- View transaction history
- Check gas prices

### Operation Examples

Here are some examples of how to interact with the wallet through natural language prompts:

#### Basic Operations
```
"What's my wallet balance?"
"Show me my recent transactions"
"What's the current gas price?"
"Get my wallet address"
```

#### Token Operations
```
"Check my USDC balance"
"Send 100 USDT to 0x123..."
"Show me my NFT collection"
"What's the current price of MONAD?"
```

#### DeFi Operations
```
"Swap 1 MONAD to USDC"
"What's the best rate for swapping 1000 USDT to MONAD?"
"Show me the liquidity pools I'm participating in"
"Calculate slippage for swapping 5 MONAD to USDC"
```

#### Cross-chain Operations
```
"Bridge 1 MONAD from Monad to Ethereum"
"What's the fee for bridging 1000 USDC to Monad?"
"Show available bridge options for MONAD to Optimism"
"Track my cross-chain transfer status"
```

#### Transaction Management
```
"Create a transaction to send 1 MONAD"
"Estimate gas fee for this transfer"
"Check the status of transaction 0x123..."
"Show my pending transactions"
```

### Security Considerations

#### Key Management
1. **Private Key Protection**:
   - Never share private keys or mnemonics with anyone
   - Store keys in secure, encrypted storage
   - Use hardware wallets for large amounts
   - Enable biometric authentication when available

2. **Access Control**:
   - Use read-only mode by default
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Set transaction limits
   - Enable multi-signature for high-value transactions

3. **Network Security**:
   - Use secure RPC endpoints
   - Implement SSL/TLS for all connections
   - Monitor for suspicious activities
   - Regular security audits

#### Transaction Safety
1. **Verification Steps**:
   - Always verify recipient addresses
   - Double-check transaction amounts
   - Review gas fees before approval
   - Confirm network/chain ID

2. **Smart Contract Safety**:
   - Verify contract addresses
   - Review contract permissions
   - Check for audited contracts
   - Use simulation before execution

3. **Approval Management**:
   - Review token approvals regularly
   - Set approval limits
   - Revoke unused approvals
   - Monitor approval expiration

#### MPC Security
1. **Multi-Party Computation**:
   - Split key shares securely
   - Use threshold signatures
   - Implement secure key recovery
   - Regular key rotation

2. **Operational Security**:
   - Use secure communication channels
   - Implement timeouts
   - Rate limiting
   - Audit logging

#### AI Assistant Integration
1. **Prompt Safety**:
   - Use clear, unambiguous language
   - Avoid sensitive information in prompts
   - Verify AI understanding
   - Review suggested actions

2. **Permission Management**:
   - Set operation limits
   - Define allowed actions
   - Implement cooling periods
   - Regular permission review

3. **Transaction Review**:
   - Mandatory human verification
   - Clear confirmation dialogs
   - Detailed transaction preview
   - Cancel option always available
